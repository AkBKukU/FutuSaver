This is a screensaver like application for the show Futurama. The goal is to make it look like the intro with all the light beams shining behind the title.

Usage
-----

You will need to compile it and make sure you have the assets and settings file. You will also need Slick set up to be able to compile. Here is a [guide] on setting up Slick with eclipse.
